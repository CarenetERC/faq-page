    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the mid-month upload & what does it mean for me?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Upon the completion of a mid-month upload, half of the month’s transactions are available in everyone’s Emburse wallet. This gives cardholders additional time in the month to prepare any expenses that have already been posted to their card. 
				<br><br>Since the timeframe between the final upload and the due date is so short, providing the mid-month upload allows you more time to be half-finished with your report ahead of time. This leaves fewer expenses for you to handle once the final upload takes place, and helps you meet the deadline with as little hassle as possible.</div>
    </div>
     
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the purpose of the "extra prep time"?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">During this time, you should be uploading any/all of your receipts for the month associated with expenses that are now in your wallet and the expenses that you know will be added in the final upload. For the expenses that were added mid-month, you can go ahead and prep them by matching receipts and coding the expenses.
				<br><br>This gives you more than a week of extra time to be prepared for the final upload and meet the deadline.
				<br><br><b>Note:</b> Reports should NOT be submitted during this time because not all of the transactions for the month are in your account yet.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">When does the statement close?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">The statement closes on or around the 26th of each month. This varies depending on the structure of the month (i.e., how the weekends fall, if there are any holidays, etc.). 
				<br><br>Because the statement closes around 6pm Central Time, all remaining transactions will be uploaded first thing in the morning on the next business day. You will receive an email notifying you after the final upload has taken place and your report can be finished and submitted.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Why do I have to wait to submit my expense report?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Expense reports must contain <b>all</b> of your transactions for the month – if you submit your report before the statement has closed and all transactions have been added to your Emburse wallet, then your report will be missing some of your transactions.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Can I submit early if all of my transactions were uploaded mid-month & I won't have any more?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">No. Since you may have unexpected purchases later in the month or an annual subscription that you didn't realize would charge in that month, we prefer for everyone to stick with the rule of not submitting their report until after the statement has closed and the final upload has been completed.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the final upload & what does it mean for me?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">The final upload contains all of your remaining expenses for the month/statement period. After the final upload has taken place, you are now ready to code & match receipts to the rest of your expenses. 
				<br><br>Now that you have all of your expenses for the month, you can submit any time between the final upload and the deadline. The deadline is always included in the same email that informs you of the final upload being complete.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the deadline for submitting my expense report?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">In general, we try to give everyone 2 business days to complete their expense report. Sometimes, because of how the month is structured, you may receive an extra day.
				<br><br><b>Note:</b> The same deadline applies for both cardholders and their approving supervisor. 
				<br><br>If your report requires your supervisor’s approval before it reaches Finance, please keep this in mind and submit your report 24 hours before the deadline to allow your supervisor enough time to review and approve your report before the deadline. To help with this, please take advantage of the extra prep time given which should lighten your load ahead of time.
				<br><br>Please communicate with your team to help the process flow as easily as possible.</div>
      </div>

           <div class="faq-item">
     	 <div class="faq-question">If I will be out of the office and/or traveling during the week that expense reports are due, what should I do?</div>
	 <div class="faq-answer">Please reach out to <a href="mailto:adgray1@carenethealth.com">Ashley Gray</a> prior to your time off/away to make a plan for your expenses.
    <br><br><b>Options:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Prior to your time off/away, you will need to upload receipts for all of your transactions for the month & code any expenses that are already available in your wallet. You will then leave coding and any pertinent information for the other expenses with Ashley Gray so that your report can be coded, finalized, and submitted in your absence.</li><br>
      <li>Prior to your time off/away, you will assign a delegate user for your expense report. You will need to ensure that your delegate is aware that they will be responsible for completing your report for you, and that you provide them with all of the necessary documentation to do so. To assign a delegate user to your account, please follow the steps provided here: <a href="https://help.certify.com/hc/en-us/articles/15457956754573-Assigning-and-Managing-Delegate-Users">Assigning and Managing Delegate Users</a>
      <br><b>Note:</b> In order to assign someone as a delegate, they must first have an Emburse account. Please reach out to <a href="adgray1@carenethealth.com">Ashley Gray</a> to request an account for a new user.</li>

     <div class="faq-item">
     	 <div class="faq-question">How and when will I be reimbursed for expenses?</div>
	 <div class="faq-answer">Reimbursements are processed on the second payroll of the following month.
				 <br><br><b>Example:</b>If an expense was submitted for reimbursement on January’s expense report, you should see the reimbursement on your second paycheck in February.</div>
    </div>
    
        <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What if I accidentally made a personal purchase on the corporate card?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Mistakes happen – so frequently that we have a category for it.
				<br><br>All you will need to do is choose the Employee Advance category for the personal purchase. The amount will then be deducted from your paycheck on the second pay day of the following month.
				<br><br><b>Note:</b> Please <b>do not</b> make payments directly to the corporate account as this greatly complicates the accounting and reconciliation process. Accidental purchases on the corporate card should <b>only</b> be handled internally via a payroll deduction by coding the expense to Employee Advance when filing your expense report.

     <div class="faq-item">
	  <div class="faq-question">What is the process for submitting an expense report?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
			<ul>
				<li>Save receipts for every purchase</li>
				<li>Upload all receipts to your Emburse wallet</li>
				<li>After the <b>mid-month upload</b>:

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How do I handle expenses with foreign currencies?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">All expenses should be submitted in USD, even if the receipt shows a different currency.
				<br><br>If the expense was charged in a foreign currency on a corporate card, the transaction will be converted to USD by American Express and uploaded to your Emburse wallet in USD. 
				<br><br>If you are submitting for reimbursement on an expense paid out of pocket, please convert the amount paid to USD using the exchange rate for the date of the purchase.
				<br><br>To convert a foreign currency to USD on a specific date, please use the <a href="https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/?from=EUR&to=USD&amount=1">Oanda Currency Converter</a>.
				<br><br>If you are an employee located in Canada and are submitting for a mileage reimbursement, please visit the <a href="https://carenethealthcare.sharepoint.com/sites/ExpenseResourceCenter/SitePages/Canadian-Expenses.aspx">Canadian Mileage Reimbursement</a> page.</div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How detailed should info in the Reason field be?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Information added to the Reason field should be as brief as possible while still being descriptive. 
				<br><br>Please be sure to never remove the information that is already populated in the Reason field as it is required information for Finance.
				<br><br>Acceptable examples added before the pre-populated information:
				<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Purchase:</strong> Notebooks, pens, envelopes, and a stapler from Amazon<br>
    <strong>Reason field:</strong> Misc. Office Supplies   AMAZON.COM   CARDHOLDER NAME

			</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What’s so important about the Reason field?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">After expenses are processed in Emburse, they are moved to QuickBooks for accounting, where we face some character limitations. Because the Reason field is the only information field that gets moved over to QuickBooks, it is a vital field that must contain important details such as what the purchase was, where the purchase was made and who made the purchase.
				<br><br>For this reason, you will see it repeatedly emphasized that the information already populated in the Reason field should never be removed.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What if I lost a receipt?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
				Per <a href="http://kfuze.carenet.local/corporate-credit-card-policy">company policy</a>, failure to maintain physical proof of each transaction made with the corporate card and provide it to the Finance department may result in a deduction from the Team Member's pay, forfeiture of right to reimbursement, and other disciplinary action. It is the cardholder's responsibility to perform due diligence to retrieve a copy from the merchant in the event of a lost receipt.
				<br><br>If the receipt is for a purchase such as a flight, hotel, or similar merchant who can provide another copy of the receipt upon request, please reach out to the merchant to request a copy.
				<br><br>If you can retrieve a copy of the receipt via the merchant’s website/app or if you received the receipt via email, please download and submit the receipt.
			  <br><br>We understand that sometimes receipts grow legs and cannot be replaced; we will accept an expense submitted without a receipt if a copy cannot be retrieved from the merchant. In this case, please leave the receipt field blank.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What if my expense report is rejected?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Any time an expense report is rejected, a comment will be on the report explaining why. You can find these comments by opening the report and clicking the comment indicators under Approval History. 
				<br><br><b>Most common reasons for a report being rejected:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Report was submitted too early and is missing transactions that were added to your wallet in the final upload. 
    In this instance, you will need to match & code the remaining transactions and add them to your report before resubmitting.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    Your report is missing transactions even though you submitted it during the proper time frame. 
    All transaction lines with the credit card icon <b>must</b> be included in your report no matter the circumstances.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    Your receipts are not properly matched up with your expenses.
    All purchases from your corporate card should have a credit card icon and a receipt icon on the same transaction line.
    If either are missing or if the icons are on separate lines, your report will be rejected if corrections are required.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What if I don’t recognize a purchase on my credit card?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">Please first research the details provided to see if the purchase is recognizable. You can search your email(s) for the company name, and search Google for “credit card charge from [company name]”.
				<br><br><b>Example:</b> Perhaps you made a purchase from the company XYZ, but the credit card transaction shows that it was a purchase from the company ABC. Researching “credit card charge from ABC” could result in finding that ABC owns XYZ, thus explaining the legitimate purchase.
				<br><br> If after researching, you still do not recognize the purchase, please call the phone number on the back of your credit card for assistance in either getting more information on the transaction or filing a fraud claim.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What if I have to file a fraud claim with the credit card company?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">To file a fraud claim with the credit card company, please call the phone number on the back of your credit card to speak with their fraud department.<br>After you have filed the claim, you will still need to include the fraudulent charge in your expense report. If the charge is easily categorized, please code it to the category that it fits in. If you are unsure what category to use, please use Prepaid - Other. In the Reason field, you can simply add “Fraud – claim filed on MM/DD/YY” for our records. Please remember that the vendor’s name and your name should not be removed from the Reason field. After the credit card company has processed the claim and refunded your credit card, you will include the refund in your expense report and code it to the same category used for the original charge.
				<br><br>After filing a fraud claim, you will be issued a new card with a new card number. In order to access your transactions, please update your card number in Emburse by following the instructions below.
				<br><br><b>Updating your card number:</b>
				<ol>
  				<li>Log into Emburse</li>
 					<li>Click your name in the top right corner</li>
  				<li>In the dropdown, click Account Settings</li>
  				<li>On the My Account page, find “Add Credit Card”</li>
  				<li>Remove any existing card numbers by clicking the x beside them</li>
  				<li>Select “AMEX” in the dropdown list above the credit card number fields</li>
  				<li>Enter your new credit card number twice</li>
  				<li>Click Save</li>

  				<li>Log into Emburse</li>
  				<li>Click your name in the top right corner</li>
